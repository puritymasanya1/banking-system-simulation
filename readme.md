# 🏦 Simple Command-Line Banking System

This is a basic Python project that simulates a banking system through the command line. It's designed to help you practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and core **Python fundamentals** like encapsulation, conditional logic, and method interaction.

## 🔧 Features

Users can:

* ✅ Create bank accounts
* 💰 Check account balances (with password verification)
* ➕ Deposit money
* ➖ Withdraw money
* 🔁 Transfer funds between accounts

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

* Python Classes & Objects
* Data Encapsulation (private attributes)
* Method Design and Validation
* Input Handling and Basic Error Checking

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python bank_system.py
   ```
2. The script demonstrates account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, and fund transfers through hardcoded examples in the `__main__` block.

## 📁 File Structure

* `bank_system.py`: Main script containing the `Bank` and `Account` classes and test logic.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add a user-friendly CLI or menu system
* Store data persistently using a database or JSON
* Add input from users instead of hardcoded values
